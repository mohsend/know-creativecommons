# Know CreativeCommons Presentation

## A little back story
Back in 2010 I prepared a MS Power point™ slideshow (when I was 17 and hyped about learning MS Office™) to explain what is CreativeCommons and how it works.  
Five years later there was a chance to give a presentation in front of a class; which I seized. I then managed to convince our team to take my old slideshow and make a good ol' ten-minute-long presentation out of it for the course.  
This repository hosts this new slideshow and more.
