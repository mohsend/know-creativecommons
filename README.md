# Know CreativeCommons Presentation

Back in 2010 I prepared a MS Power point™ slideshow (when I was 17 and hyped about learning MS Office™) to explain what is CreativeCommons and how it works.  
Five years later there was a chance to give a presentation in front of a university course which I seized. I convinced our group to take the old slideshow and make a good 10 minute-long presentation out of it.  
This repository hosts the modified slideshow and more.
